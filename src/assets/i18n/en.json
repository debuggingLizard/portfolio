Furthermore, the data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p><br> <p><strong>Note on the applicability of GDPR and Swiss DSG:</strong> These data protection notices serve both to provide information under the Swiss Data Protection Act (DSG) and under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader geographical application and understandability, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, instead of the terms \"processing\" of \"personal data\", \"overriding interest\" and \"special categories of personal data\" used in the Swiss DSG, the terms \"processing\" of \"personal data\" as well as \"legitimate interest\" and \"special categories of data\" used in the GDPR are used.

Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data endangerment. In addition, we consider the protection of personal data in the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures according to the principle of data protection through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.</p><br> <p>Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect the data of users transmitted through our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions meet the highest security standards. When a website is secured with an SSL/TLS certificate, it is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL.
